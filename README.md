# Collection of codes to plot the signal-to-noise ratio for the leading-order relativistic effects 

- OO version: readable but slow
- doppler + doppler model 3: optimised versions at the cost of readability for euclid luminosity function models 1 and 3 respectively 
- comparison with Yankelevich & Porciani arXiv 1807.07076 - we reproduce their results when removing co-linear (flat, zero-area) triangles. We include flattened triangles in our computations - counting algorithm verified against 1908.01774
